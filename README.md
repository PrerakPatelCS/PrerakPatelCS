# Hi Im Prerak Patel
#### Ever since I was a child, I have been driven to create things that could help others. Thanks to GitHub, I can share my projects with the community. I hope that someone can benefit from it or find it useful. I am excited to work on bigger projects where I can apply my skills. I look forward to learning from the community and am always open to working on any projects!
